# Specification Quality Checklist: Data Source Response Caching and Versioning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified and resolved
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Clarification session 2026-04-26: 4 questions asked and answered.
  - External source failure → propagate error, no fallback
  - Security posture → inherit platform model, no additional cache-layer controls
  - Concurrent write semantics → insert-always, both entries retained
  - Case-linking with multiple entries → link most recent valid entry only
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
